# SQL Query Generator using Gemini-pro and SQLite

## Description:
This project aims to create a simple demonstration application for utilizing GenerativeAI's Large Language Models (LLM) to generate SQL queries based on natural language input. The application further executes these queries on a SQLite database, retrieving and presenting the resulting data to the user.

## Goal:
The primary goal of this project is to showcase the capabilities of GenerativeAI's Large Language Models in understanding and generating SQL queries from natural language descriptions. The specific objectives include:

1. Demonstration of LLM Capabilities: Showcase the ability of GenerativeAI's Large Language Models, particularly the Gemini model, to comprehend natural language inputs and convert them into accurate SQL queries.
2. Ease of Use: Provide a user-friendly interface where users can input their requirements in plain English without needing to know SQL syntax, thereby demonstrating the potential for simplifying complex tasks through natural language processing.
3. Integration with SQLite: Integrate the generated SQL queries with a SQLite database, enabling the execution of these queries to retrieve relevant data.
4. Presentation of Results: Present the results obtained from executing the SQL queries back to the user in a structured format, demonstrating the end-to-end functionality of the application.

## Expected Outcome:
By the end of the project, users should be able to interact with the application by providing natural language descriptions of their querying needs. The application, powered by GenerativeAI's Gemini model, should be able to generate accurate SQL queries based on these descriptions, execute them on the SQLite database, and present the retrieved data back to the user in a clear and understandable format.
